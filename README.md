# TalesTerrain

## Introduction

TalesTerrain is a dynamic world generator created specifically for [TaleSpire](https://talespire.com/), a 3D tabletop RPG map builder. TaleSpire allows users to build immersive game maps, but traditionally focuses on smaller scales like dungeons. TalesTerrain expands these possibilities, enabling the effortless creation of vast, open-world environments.

## TaleSpire Overview

TaleSpire is a digital platform for building and playing tabletop RPGs in a stunning 3D environment. It's known for its flexibility in creating detailed dungeons and smaller map segments.
